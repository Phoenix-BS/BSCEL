# How To Use

- Left / Right Lasers Are set along the sides of the track and remain functionally the same
- The Crystal objects that are tied to right lasers now sit behind the HUD and remain functionally the same
- Back Lasers sit at an angle below the floor and remain functionally the same
- Big Ring Neons are scaled up and adjusted slightly yet remain functionally the same
- KDA Light Sticks are in the same positions as standard and modified scale to spread forward indefinitely. They remain functionally the same
- The Front Light overarches the environment front and center and remains functionally the same
