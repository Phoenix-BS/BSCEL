### How To Setup User Environments

1. Locate your game folders
2. Starting at Beat Saber, go to > User Data > Chroma > Environments
3. Drag and Drop the .dat files you've downloaded into this folder
(If your game was open or if you modified the files in any way while you did this you'll need to close and re-launch the game)
