### How To Setup User Environments

1. Locate your Beat Saber Install's Folder and starting at Beat Saber, go to > User Data > Chroma > Environments
2. Drag and Drop the .dat files you've downloaded into this folder
(If your game was open or if you modified the files in any way while you did this you'll need to close and re-launch the game in order for your changes to take effect)

All User Environments found in the [Interactive](https://github.com/Phoenix-BS/BSCEL/tree/main/Environments/User20%Environments/Interactive) Folder are engineered to be compatible with most lightshows in other maps
All User Environments found in the [Static](https://github.com/Phoenix-BS/BSCEL/tree/main/Environments/User20%Environments/Static) Folder are only useable with static lights since not all elements of them are compatible with other lightshows

# Other Notes
- Not all user environments have matching scripts in this chroma library
- Some of these environments have been altered to be more compatible with others lightshows and are in turn different from their cooresponding map scripts
