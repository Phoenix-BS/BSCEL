### How To Setup User Environments

1. Locate your game folders
2. Starting at Beat Saber, go to > User Data > Chroma > Environments
3. Drag and Drop the .dat files you've downloaded into this folder
(If your game was open or if you modified the files in any way while you did this you'll need to close and re-launch the game in order for your changes to take effect)

Some of these user environments have been modified to be more universal for maps. This includes the following:

- Ascension Environment: Modified the rings to be smaller and in front of the player instead of behind
