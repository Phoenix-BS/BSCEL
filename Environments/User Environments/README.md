### How To Setup User Environments

1. Locate your game folders
2. Locate your Beat Saber Install's Folder and starting at Beat Saber, go to > User Data > Chroma > Environments
3. Drag and Drop the .dat files you've downloaded into this folder
(If your game was open or if you modified the files in any way while you did this you'll need to close and re-launch the game in order for your changes to take effect)

All User Environments found in the [Interactive](https://github.com/Phoenix-BS/BSCEL/tree/main/Environments/User20%Environments/Interactive) Folder are engineered to be compatible with most lightshows in other maps
All User Environments found in the [Static](https://github.com/Phoenix-BS/BSCEL/tree/main/Environments/User20%Environments/Static) Folder are legacy environments that were not made to be compatible with other lightshows and therefore will only work with static lights

Some of these environments have been altered to be more compatible with others lightshows and are in turn different from their cooresponding map scripts
