# Setup

Currently Chromapper does not support the Gaga environment so all the chroma light ID's are bound to the default environment!
To fix this, Locate your `"_environmentName"` parameter in your info.dat file and set the environment to `GagaEnvironment'`
This should display GagaEnvironment as the environment in Chromapper and should use Default LightID's when you open the diff

# How To Use

- Back Lasers will effect the lights from the bridge supports below (not compatible with LightID's)
- Center Lights effect the aurora in the background of the environmnt (not compatible with LightID's)
- Big Rings will effect the floating light strips in the sky, each is randomized in LightID's so there is no order in the LightID's
- Left / Right lasers shoot out from the sides of the bridge and are effected by LightID's (1-7)
