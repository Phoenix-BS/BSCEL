# How To Use

- Left / Right Lasers Are hovering along the sides of the track and remain functionally the same
- Water 4 are the railing lights on the right, Water 3 are the railing lights on the left
- Water 1 are the flat lighs at the bottom closer to the center, Water 2 are the flat lights at the bottom further from the center
- Left / Right Sunbeams line the water bridge and with laser speed float around the bridge in a circle formation
- Sun lights the stars in the background (Does not work with ID's)
- The Aurora like object in the background will react to all other light in the environment and is sensitive so try fiddling around with it to see how it reacts
- Boost Lights get rid of the stars in the back
