# How To Use

- Center Lights effect the big diamond shape in the center (Does not work with ID's)
- Big Rings will effect the light sticks that rotate around the bridge itself and stays fundementally the same
- Ring Spins work as normal, however Ring Zooms don't since they are non-functional in Origins
- Left / Right lasers are on the sides of the bridge and remain fundementally the same
- The Light Bridge itself is a particle in origins that turns on with Left / Right lasers
- Back lasers are the 4 light sticks at the bottom of the bridge
- The tiles along the sides of the bridge are Spectrograms and react to sounds as the should
