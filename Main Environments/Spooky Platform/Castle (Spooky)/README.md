# How To Use

- Left / Right Lasers function the same as the base game environment
- Top lights effect the sticks shooting up in the distance of the environment
- Moon lights effect both the stars in the sky and the subtle bloom light in the back of the environment. Only works with all light events
- Lane lights effect the road borders on the left and right of the environment.
- The script contains animation data so that you can make the illusion of the road moving.
