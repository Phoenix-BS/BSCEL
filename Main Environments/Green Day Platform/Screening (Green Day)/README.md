# How To Use

- Left / Right lasers are suspended above the player and remain functionally the same
- Center Lights effect the bloom that sticks out from the player platform
- Ring Lights are attatched around the players periferal vision. (does not work with ring zoom) (only functional w/ all lights)
- Ring Lights IDs are attatched to the screen lights. By default there are 4 screens w/ 30 lights each. This requires 120 lights which means you will need to use the extended lightID's chromapper plugin. If you want to change these values to be below that limit, you will need 60 or lower. Set multiples of 60 for the optimal effect (4 * 15, 2 * 30, etc.)
- Back Lasers are hooked up to the tube formation lights around the environment. LightID 1 is the leftmost column, LightID 16 is the rightmost column
