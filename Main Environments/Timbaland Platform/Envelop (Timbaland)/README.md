# How To Use

- All lightID's function the same as the base game however the lights themselves are moved
- Left / Right lasers stretch from the front to behind the player
- Big Rings are shaped to rectangles similar to green day rings
- Back lasers are built so that laser rotation speed can have them grow and shrink in perspective. For full control it's recommended you use precise laser rotation.
- Center lights effect the diamond shape in the background. It's split into 4 segments that match the 4 ID's
