# BSCEL
Welcome! BSCEL (Beat-Saber-Chroma-Environment-Library) Is a Multi-purpose database of Chroma modified environments that are free for anyone to use!

<br>

If you use anything from this library make sure you do the following:
- If you use any of these listed environments in your chroma maps make sure that you credit the original makers of the environment even if you modified it yourself.
- Do not take any form of false credit or claim that anything from this library is your own when it isn't.
- Respect my privacy in my creatinos. If an environment isn't located in this database but is made by me, you can ask me for permission to use it but chances are I want it exclusive to certain projects and maps.

<br>

It's highly recommended you have some experience with JSON and other general forms of coding knowledge when browsing this library. Here are some helpful resources that you can reference if necessary:
