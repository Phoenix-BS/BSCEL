# BSCEL
Welcome! BSCEL (Beat-Saber-Chroma-Environment-Library) Is a Database where i'll be uploading all of my chroma environment scripts for you to use and experiment with!

In This library you can find the following:
- Map Scripts (Marked as JavaScript Source Files)
- User Shared Environments (Marked as .dat Files)

If you use anything from this library make sure you do the following:
- If you use any of these listed environments in your chroma maps make sure that you credit the original makers of the environment even if you modified it yourself.
- Do not take any form of false credit or claim that anything from this library is your own when it isn't.
- If you find a map that does not give proper credit please respectfully either reach out to the publisher of the map notifying them or reach out to the person behind the environment.

Notice that everything is optimized and limited only to my coding knowledge, so there's never a guarantee the environments are future proof and fully optimized. It's for this reason that it's recommended you have some experience with JSON and other general forms of coding knowledge when browsing this library. Here are some helpful resources that you can reference if necessary:
- https://github.com/Aeroluna/Heck/wiki
- https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/
- https://chromapper.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UG/overview

This library was heavily inspired by [Lonely's Chroma Environment Library](https://github.com/LonelyCen/Chroma-Environments) and is dedicated to Lone <3

If you're just here for the already setup User Shared Environment versions you can click [here](https://github.com/Phoenix-BS/BSCEL/tree/main/Environments/User%20Environments) to see the full list

If you have any questions or concerns feel free to reach out to me on discord! **phoenix5_**
