# BSCEL
Welcome! BSCEL (Beat-Saber-Chroma-Environment-Library) Is a Database where i'll be putting up all of my chroma environment scripts for you to use and experiment with!

This Library is currently WIP and will be updated semi-frequently for the forseeable future.

Before you explore this library it's important to know how things are made and what you can do with them
- If you use any of these listed environments in your chroma maps we ask that you credit the original makers of the environment even if you modified it yourself. This includes at minimum a mention in your beatsaver map description, as well as preferrable a mention in the contributors tab of your map file.
- Do not take any form of false credit or claim that anything from this library is your own
- If you find a map that does not give proper credit please respectfully either reach out to the publisher of the map notifying them or reach out to the person behind the environment. Do not escalate this further, harassment is not cool.
- Just because something isn't mentioned in this list doesn't make it automatically OK. Use common sense.

Notice that everything is optimized and limited only to my coding knowledge, so there's never a garuantee the environments are future proof and fully optimized. It's for this reason that it's recommended you have some experience with JSON and other general forms of coding knowledge. To find original info, go to https://github.com/Aeroluna/Heck/wiki
