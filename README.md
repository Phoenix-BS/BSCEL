# V3CEL
Welcome! V3CEL (V3-Chroma-Environment-Library) Is a Project that is being run to serve as a database for those who want Custom Chroma Environments for their Beat Saber Charts!

This index of environments is a showcase of environments mainly made by me and others so you can not only use them with credit to spice up your chroma shows, but to also dissect how things are done and learn some interesting techniques to apply to your own environment creation!

This Library is currently WIP and will be updated semi-frequently for the forseeable future.

Before you explore this library it's important to know how things are made and what you can do with them
- If you use any of these listed environments in your chroma maps we ask that you credit the original makers of the environment even if you modified it yourself. This includes at minimum a mention in your beatsaver map description, as well as preferrable a mention in the contributors tab of your map file.
- Do not take any form of false credit or claim that anything from this library is your own
- If you find a map that does not give proper credit please respectfully either reach out to the publisher of the map notifying them or reach out to the person behind the environment. Do not escalate this further, harassment is not cool.
- Just because something isn't mentioned in this list doesn't make it automatically OK. Use common sense.

Every environment you find will contain important info including an author and other limitatiions. These include the following:
-Environment Name
-Environment Author(s)
-Base Environment
-Coding Language / Tool used to make environment
-What map format versions are compatible?
-Brief description of the environment and other features of it (LightID's, Geometry, Shaders, etc.)
-Still image of the environment
-List to show what colored lights in the image coorespond to what types of lights in editor

Currently this library is only suitable to host my own environments that i've made, support for others to put their environments on here will come later. If you know your way around GitHub and want to help organize this database, shoot me a discord dm! Ph√∏enix#5713
