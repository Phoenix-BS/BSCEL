How to Use:  
If you plan on using cm for chroma ids i HIGHLY suggest getting the ExtendedLightIDs plugin found here: https://github.com/MoistSac/ChroMapper-ExtendedLightIDs which allows you to see the added light ids using alt+p.  
Back Lasers: no light id is needed, it is just a filler light that eliminates the main area.  
Inner Ring: Needs light ids. 101-103 are the big lasers (101 middle, 102 left, 103 right) 104-106 is the 3 sides for the pyramid (104 middle, 105 right, 106 left) 107-109 is the 3 balls (107 left, 108 middle, 109 right) and 110 is the floor for the whole env (can be VERY bright so be carefull)  
Left and Right Lasers: uses light ids 1,7,13,19,22,25 in that order from close to far  

Tracks:  
has tracks on the balls so you can move them which are "track": "Ballleft", "track": "Ballmid", and "track": "Ballright", respectively
