# Community Hub
This page of the library is dedicated to community submitted environments that remain free to use the same as the [Main Environments](https://github.com/Phoenix-BS/BSCEL/tree/main/Main%20Environments).

If you want to submit something here for public access you can dm me on discord (**phoenix5_**) and send me the following:
- Environment name
- Base environment
- Difficulty file with the environment and all relating information stored
- screenshot showcasing the environment itself
- (optional) info related on how to use the environment in editor

Environments submitted will not be monitored or kept to the same setup methods that are used in the [Main Environments](https://github.com/Phoenix-BS/BSCEL/tree/main/Main%20Environments). There is no garuantee that these environments are futureproof. Use at your own risk!
