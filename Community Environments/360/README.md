How to Use:  
If you plan on using CM for chroma ids I HIGHLY suggest getting the ExtendedLightIDs plugin found here: https://github.com/MoistSac/ChroMapper-ExtendedLightIDs which allows you to see the added light ids using alt+p.   
Everything is on Left and Right Rotating Laser, each of which using light ids 1-36 making 36 lasers on each side.
