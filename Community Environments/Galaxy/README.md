How to Use:  
If you plan on using cm for chroma ids i HIGHLY suggest getting the ExtendedLightIDs plugin found here: https://github.com/MoistSac/ChroMapper-ExtendedLightIDs which allows you to see the added light ids using alt+p.   
Everything is on Left Rotating Laser: the auroraâ€™s use light ids 101-125  
Tracks: all the auroras have the "track": "Aurora" then with now space 1-26 (ex: "Aurora10") so you can use animation tracks to move them if you know how
