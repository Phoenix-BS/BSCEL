Environment that is a flying galaxy in the sky

How to install:
This is the easy way for people who don't know how chroma coding works. First go into a map in cm, click on the pickaxe button on the bottom. Then add one thing to the list (don't have to put anything in the text box). Then change the environment to Gaga.
Then hit the open folder button on the bottom left. Open up the diff you just added the pickaxe stuff to and find (use ctrl+f to search for the word) to find where it says "environment". Copy all text in the .dat file called env.dat here and paste it over both the "environment" and the [ ] and what is in it. You should then be good to go with using it in cm. 

How to Use:
If you plan on using cm for chroma ids i HIGHLY suggest getting the ExtendedLightIDs plugin found here: https://github.com/MoistSac/ChroMapper-ExtendedLightIDs which allows you to see the added light ids using alt+p. 
Everything is on Left Rotating Laser: the auroraâ€™s use light ids 101-125
Tracks: all the auroras have the "track": "Auroras" so you can use animation tracks to move them if you know how
