Summery:
Environment that is a parting of the seas and has many reflections and lasers 

How to install:
This is the easy way for people who don't know how chroma coding works. First go into a map in cm, click on the pickaxe button on the bottom. Then add one thing to the list (don't have to put anything in the text box). Then change the environment to Billie.
Then hit the open folder button on the bottom left. Open up the diff you just added the pickaxe stuff to and find (use ctrl+f to search for the word) to find where it says "environment". Copy all text in the .dat file called env.dat here and paste it over both the "environment" and the [ ] and what is in it. You should then be good to go with using it in cm. 

How to Use:
If you plan on using cm for chroma ids i HIGHLY suggest getting the ExtendedLightIDs plugin found here: https://github.com/MoistSac/ChroMapper-ExtendedLightIDs which allows you to see the added light ids using alt+p.  
Note: untested with boost colors/the moon  
Left and Right Sunbeams: Same a base game.  
Sun: Same as base game but bigger and has a track  
Left and Right Lasers: lasers on left and right going from ids 1-9, close to far  
Water  1: has the closest lines on the floor on both sides using light id 1-2  
Water 2: Has the 2rd closest lines on the floor on both sides using light id 1-2  
Water 3: light id 101 has a water splashing effect far in the distance. Also has the 3rd closest lines on the floor on both sides using light id 1-2  
Water 4: Has the 2 Big lasers on the bottom of the Waterfalls using ids 5-6. Also has the farthest lines on the floor on both sides using light id 1-2  

Tracks: has tracks on the sun so you can move it with "track": "sun"
